Welcome to the Bengaluru House Price Prediction Model project! üè°üí∞

Project Overview:

In this project, we've developed a sophisticated machine learning model that can predict house prices in Bengaluru, India. Our goal was to create a tool that allows users to estimate the price of a house based on their specified location, total square footage, the number of bathrooms (bath), and the number of bedrooms (bhk).

Key Features:

House Price Prediction: Our model can provide you with an estimated house price based on the location and your specific requirements.
Technical Details:

Data Preprocessing: We've performed extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation to prepare the dataset for accurate predictions.

Optimized Dataset: Through careful analysis and optimization, we achieved a remarkable 81% accuracy in predicting house prices.

Machine Learning Algorithm Selection: We conducted a grid search to identify the most suitable machine learning algorithm for our model. The results showed that the linear regression model was the best fit for our dataset, ensuring precise and reliable predictions.

How to Use:

To estimate the price of a house, you can input your desired location, total square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms. Our model will then provide you with an accurate estimate of the house's price in Bengaluru.

Feel free to explore the code, dataset, and project details in this repository. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're excited to share our work with the community and contribute to the field of real estate analytics.
